title: Project 1 – IMDB Ratings Analysis

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<div class="blurb-section">
  <div class="blurb-text">
    <p>
      This project is an analysis of Internet Movie Database (IMDB) movie ratings,
      focusing on whether genre, popularity, and runtime are associated with
      differences in IMDB ratings. I completed it for an introductory statistical
      methods course, and it was one of my first end‑to‑end projects using R on a
      real, non‑curated dataset scraped directly from IMDB.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cleaned and manipulated the data in R and primarily relied on multiple
      regression and ANOVA to investigate relationships between predictors and
      ratings. While the final model did not yield strong or statistically
      significant effects, the experience of wrestling with messy real‑world
      data, checking assumptions, and exploring different model specifications
      was extremely valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the analysis itself was not especially groundbreaking, this
      project built my comfort with R, data wrangling, and iterative model
      building. It also reinforced that not every dataset produces neat,
      publishable results, but there is still a lot to learn from the process.
