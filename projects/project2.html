title: Project 2 – MLB Lineup Construction

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This project analyzes Major League Baseball (MLB) lineup construction and how
      hitter statistics vary by lineup position. Working with a partner, I hoped
      to build a model for optimal lineup construction, but the complexity of the
      problem and our level of statistical training led us to focus on describing
      and confirming existing patterns instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We used R throughout, drawing on data from RetroSheet and Baseball Reference,
      connected via the BaseballR package. A large portion of the work involved
      merging and aligning the two datasets, which required careful reformatting
      and explicit handling of inconsistencies in player names and identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, we confirmed several classic ideas about lineup construction:
      hitters in the 1 and 2 spots tended to have the highest on‑base percentages,
      the 3‑hole hitter was often the best overall, and the 4 and 5 spots housed
      the strongest power hitters. More than anything, the project reinforced the
      importance of data cleaning, using multiple data sources, and supplementing
      analysis with background research.
