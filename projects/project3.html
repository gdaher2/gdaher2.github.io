<h2>Project Overview</h2>

      This project was completed for the 2023 ASA DataFest, a weekend‑long data
      hackathon where undergraduate teams explore a large, complex dataset with
      minimal guidance. My team and I competed at RIT as members of the Society
      of Undergraduate Statistics Students at the University of Rochester.

      The data came from the American Bar Association’s online legal advice
      platform and consisted of multiple related tables that were not pre‑cleaned
      for analysis. A substantial portion of our effort went into merging and
      reshaping the data so that different analytical questions could be answered
      effectively.

      We ultimately focused on seasonality in the volume of questions and
      responses across the year. Our findings suggested that the platform could
      better allocate resources by aligning staffing and support with periods of
      higher demand. Personally, this project was also an opportunity to contribute
      as the only underclassman on the team, build confidence working under tight
      time constraints, and experiment with incorporating external data such as
      Google search trends.
