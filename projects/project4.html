title: Project 4 – Simulation Study of Parametric vs Nonparametric

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This project is a simulation study comparing the performance of parametric
      and nonparametric methods in different data‑generating scenarios. In
      particular, I studied Welch’s t‑test versus the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon rank
      sum test under varying distributional shapes, tail behavior, and effect sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulations were written in R and examined power and type I error across
      a range of sample sizes, asymmetries, and kurtoses. By systematically
      varying these conditions, I could see when the parametric assumptions held
      reasonably well and when nonparametric methods provided a more robust
      alternative.
    </p>

      This was my first full simulation study, and it required careful design of
      the data‑generating mechanisms as well as efficient code for running and
      summarizing thousands of iterations. It deepened both my understanding of
      the underlying theory and my comfort translating that theory into code.
