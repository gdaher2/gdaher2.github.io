      This project was completed for the 2024 ASA DataFest, again held at RIT.
      The dataset came from CourseKata, an online learning platform for statistics,
      and consisted of multiple related tables that were not pre‑prepared for
      analysis. Our team decided to focus on understanding patterns of missingness
      in the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using R, we explored where and how data were missing, and we found strong
      evidence that the missingness was not random. As a result, we argued that
      any downstream analysis using these data would need to incorporate careful
      imputation or modeling of the missingness mechanism to avoid biased
      conclusions.
    </p>

      Participating in DataFest for a second time gave me the chance to build on
      what I had learned the previous year while working with teammates whose
      skills complemented my own. It also reinforced the importance of treating
      missing data as a substantive part of the analysis rather than a side issue.
