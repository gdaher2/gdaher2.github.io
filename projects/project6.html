title: Project 6 – FEC Election Analysis

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      In this project, I examined whether the better‑funded candidate in an
      election typically wins, using campaign finance data from the Federal
      Election Commission (FEC). I completed the work for an advanced statistical
      programming class and chose the topic out of personal interest in elections
      and political data.
    </p>
    <p>
      A significant portion of the project involved cleaning and restructuring
      both the finance data and the election results, which were formatted more
      for human consumption than for analysis. Matching race results, handling
      paired outcomes, and ensuring that data were correctly aligned required
      extensive preprocessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attempted to fit logistic regression models to election outcomes using
      funding information and related predictors. Although some models converged
      and appeared significant, they ultimately failed goodness‑of‑fit checks,
      underscoring the challenges of modeling complex election processes.
      The project was still valuable for the experience of working through
      practical obstacles, consulting the literature, and iterating on model
      design.
