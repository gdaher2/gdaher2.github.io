title: Project 7 – Principal Component Decomposition

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This project is an examination of Principal Component Decomposition (PCD)
      as a method for analyzing and compressing high‑dimensional data, with a
      particular focus on images. I completed it for an advanced statistical
      methods course in order to deepen my understanding of both the linear
      algebra and the statistical intuition behind PCD.

      Using R, I demonstrated how images can be decomposed into principal
      components and then reconstructed using different numbers of components.
      By comparing reconstructions across images with varying symmetry and visual
      complexity, I explored how the underlying structure of an image influences
      how efficiently it can be represented with a small number of components.

      The project was especially rewarding because it bridged coursework in
      statistics and linear algebra. The visual nature of the results also made
      it easier to interpret what the principal components were capturing and
      how much information was lost when truncating the decomposition.
